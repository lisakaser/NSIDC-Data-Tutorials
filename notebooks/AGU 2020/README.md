# AGU 2020 tutorials 

## Summary 

### Tutorial 4: 
Exploring lake bathymetry measurement distribution and changes over time to inform water resource management. This is provided as a video (plus notebook...?) 

* Request a geographic region of interest for data hosted in the cloud and on premise, hosted by several data centers.

* Data tool focus: Discover and visualize inland water height values via OpenAltimetry

* Lessons learned: Explore data distribution and availability prior to accessing and reading the data files


### Tutorial 5: 
Access coincident sea ice and ocean data to study melt pond characteristics

* Help user narrow down the amount of data needed for a given need. Especially relevant when working with big data volumes. Some data is cloud-based, some is still on prem, user can work with both types of data regardless of whether in the cloud or not.

* subset by bounding box
* Harmony (L2SS) API
* OPeNDAP (cloud) - TBD

* sea ice (NSIDC)
* MODIS SST L2 (PODAAC) 
* SMAP SSS L3 (PODAAC) (if available)

## Key Learning Objectives
